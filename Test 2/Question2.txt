Explain the node js architecture with the internal work of event loop ?
 
 1. Node js is a function programming language
 2. Asynchronous event
 3. Architecture is controlled by the main thread
 4. main thread is maintain the flow.
 5. main threads are the threads which is controlled all the nodes.
 6. it include
    - Application
    - V8 
    - Node JS binding
    - Event Queue
    - Worker thread
    - Blocking operation
    - Execute callback

  V8 
   - Javascript engine
   
  Event loop
   - It is equilent to event loop which is follows FIFO(First In First Out) data structure.
   - advantage: it has a capacity to execute multiple nodeJs instanaces at the same time.

  Event Queue
   - It is internal data structure
   - Execution program
   - Event: action performed on that object
            In that we know what are going to do.
   - Queue: Follows FIFO

  Worker Thread
   - Thread is a smallest process of an Application
   - eg. addition, substraction and any kind of mathematical operation.
