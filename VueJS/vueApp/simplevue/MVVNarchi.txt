MVVM Arcitecture:
- In MVVM, the mediator is the view model
- In MVVM , the view has reference to the viewmodel
- communication is two- way using data-binding


Model -- View Model -- View

Model : 
    - Model represents the app domain model which can include data model as well as bussiness and validation logic
    - It communicates with the view model.

View :
    - It is user interface of the application.
    - It communicates with the view model through data binding

View model :
    - The view Model is link between the view and model or we can say that is is bridge between the view and model
    - It implements public properties and commands that the view uses by way of data binding.

Working of MVVM architecture 
- In MVVM architecture , their are three key components which rare interact to each other.
- Since the view only communicates with the viewmodel and the viewmodel only communicates with the model
- All user interactions  occurs within the View, which is in charge of detecting the user’s input (mouse clicks, keyboard input) and 
forwarding it to the ViewModel by way of data binding. Data binding can be implemented with callbacks or properties and constitutes the 
concrete link between the View and the ViewModel. 
- The ViewModel implements the properties and commands to which the view can be bound. These properties and commands define the 
functionality that the View can offer to the user, although how to display it is entirely up to the View.
- he Models are classes that model the application’s domain. Models encapsulate the application’s data and business logic.
